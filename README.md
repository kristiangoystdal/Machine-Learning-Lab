# Machine Learning Lab

This repository contains practical machine learning exercises designed to demonstrate various techniques, including regression, neural networks, data augmentation, and more. It provides Python implementations and associated datasets for hands-on learning.

## Repository Structure

- **Lab_1**: Implementation of regression models with datasets for training and testing.
  - `regression.py`: Core implementation of regression techniques.
  - `report_code.py`: Code for generating reports on the regression models.
  - Dataset files: `X_train.npy`, `y_train.npy`, etc.
  
- **Lab_2**: Exercises focusing on data visualization and analysis.
  - `main.py`: Main script for the lab.
  - `plot_csv.py`: Script for visualizing CSV data.
  - Dataset files: `output_train.npy`, `u_train.npy`, etc.

- **Lab_3**: Implementation of neural networks and data augmentation.
  - `main/`: Contains scripts for model creation, data augmentation, and prediction visualization.
  - `checker.py`: Script for validating models.
  - Dataset files: `Xtrain1.npy`, `Ytest1_pred.npy`, etc.

- **Lab_4**: Advanced exercises with multi-part datasets.
  - Dataset files: `Xtest2_a.npy`, `Xtrain2_a.npy`, `Ytrain2_a.npy`, etc.

- **AAutLab2425.pdf**: Detailed documentation or instructions for the lab exercises.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Additional dependencies based on the lab requirements.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kristiangoystdal/Machine-Learning-Lab.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Lab
   ```

3. Install necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(If `requirements.txt` is not available, manually install packages used in the scripts.)*

## Usage

Navigate to the desired lab directory and run the scripts using Python. For example:

```bash
python Lab_1/regression.py
```

Modify the datasets and parameters in the scripts as needed to test various configurations.
